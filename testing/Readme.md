# Unit test

# **CPU Automata for basic robot**

For the testing of the CPU automata we created a file called `test.py` which includes the commands and expected outputs of the different test. In this case it creates a file called input.txt that is used by the `main.py` file to move the robot, the `test.py` file gets the console printed output and compares it with the expected output to know if the test passed or failed.

In this case we did 4 test cases, 3 in which the robot doesnâ€™t exit the map and one in which it passes the limit, all of this cases passed the test successfully.
